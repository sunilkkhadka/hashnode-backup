### Introduction

Debounce is a technique used to rate the limit at which a function is called, particularly in response to user interactions like text input, mouse events, scroll etc. It helps improve performance by limiting excessive function calls.

<mark>Debouncing ensures that a function is only executed after a specified delay since the last time it was invoked</mark>. This means the function will wait for some additional time after the user has finished a series of rapid actions before execution. If the function is called within the specified delay, the counter resets.

<mark>A good example of debounce implementation is the auto save feature in the hashnode text editor itself or the Microsoft word</mark>. The editor will wait for a brief second (e.g 300 milliseconds) after the last keystroke before triggering the save operation. If you continue typing within that time period, the counter resets and the save function doesn’t execute until you stop typing.

### How to implement debounce?

The basic idea involves the following steps:

1. Create a `debounce` function. It should accept a callback and a delay as a parameter.
    
2. Create a `timer` variable that stores reference to a `setTimeout()` and initialize it to null.
    
3. Inside the `debounce` function, return a new function that handles the execution of callback after certain delay.
    
4. Check if the timer holds reference to a `setTimeout()` inside the returned function. If it does, reset the `timer` by calling `clearTimeout()` on that `timer` variable. This ensures that any subsequent `setTimeout()` doesn’t execute while an event is being triggered.
    
5. Set `timer` to a new `setTimeout` that will execute the `callback` function after the specified `delay` time. Pass any arguments from the new function call to `callback` if needed.
    

Example:

<mark>index.html</mark>

```xml
<input type="text" placeholder="type here..." id="input"/>
<p>Output: <span id="output"></span></p>
```

<mark>debounce.js</mark>

```javascript
const input = document.getElementById("input");
const output = document.getElementById("output");

function debounce(cb, delay = 1000) {
    let timer = null;
    return (text) => {
        clearTimeout(timer);
        timer = setTimeout(() => cb(text), delay)    
    }
}

const debounceEventHandler = debounce((text) => {
    output.innerText = text
})

input.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
    debounceEventHandler(e.target.value)
})
```

### Implementation Example

I created a simple name searching example to simulate how a debounced function makes a significant difference in the number of APIs requested vs when a function isn’t debounced. You can check and uncheck the debounce checkbox to switch between debounce mode.
